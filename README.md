# SeaBattleParadox
SeaBattleParadox is a Software that relies on JavaLogic Package. The JavaLogic Package is an Advanced Package that contains Ternary Logic (3 state) Logical Expression Code.
The SeaBattleParadox Software has been designed to take a Possibility String from the User and test its continency. If the Possibility String is contingent(Unknown), then take the Realization String from the User and work out 
    • Possibility && Realization (Function : A3VLSingle3VL1Rel in ContingentExpression.java )
    • Possibility || Realization(Function : A3VLSingle3VL2Rel in ContingentExpression.java )
Note: if Possibility String is NOT CONTINGENT , the Realization string will not be evaluated.
